My executive career spans over 37 years, with in-depth expertise in 3 main roles: 
<ul>
<li> Product, </li>
<li> Project,</li>
<li> Delivery Management.</li>
</ul>
<br>
These interrelated positions gave me hands-on experience :
<br>
<ul>
<li>   in all areas of our business,</li>
<li>to adapt to the fluid changes (internal and external) of the Travel Industry, which is both competitive and innovative,</li>
<li>to coach people. It gave me great satisfaction to help many juniors evolve,</li>
<li>to participate in Industry events and</li>
<li>o use new methodologies over the years (the latest one being SAFE).</li>

As VP (Product Management) based in Nice, I defined products/solutions (e.g. design, positioning, 
pricing, business cases, contracts) in cooperation with numerous teams in our organization 
(a product/solution is never defined by one team only!). I managed customers in North-America, 
Europe and Asia-Pacific, from pre-sales until implementation, managed customer forums, and led a 
large team responsible for the entire Airline IT Product portfolio (Reservation, Inventory, Departure Control).
 
As Program Director based in Seoul, I successfully implemented, within a 3 year-period, 
a large program which required an effort of circa 700 man-years of development and implementation. 
This program has contributed to the success of our Airline IT and Distribution business units in APAC.
 
As VP (Delivery Management) based in Singapore, I contributed to the growth of our business in APAC 
by building and establishing a strong team which delivered a multitude of solutions. 
My team successfully managed Digital Competency Centres, effectively managed  Service Level Agreements, 
and provided a high quality of service and support to all customers in the region. We also supported 
the Sales and Account Management teams.
 
 
My objective now is to share my knowledge with any IT company, across any industry sector, 
in addition to the Travel Industry. However, when I say "share my knowledge", I mean creatively 
apply my knowledge to the business, cognisant and adapted to the specific environment of a customer. 
This is my value proposition.

Some of the areas I can support you in, but not limited to, are :
projects, solution design, digital transformation, organization changes, coaching people, 
and service level agreements.
